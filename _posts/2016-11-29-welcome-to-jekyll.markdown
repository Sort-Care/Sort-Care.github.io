I am a senior student in JLU, working on earning a U.S. graduate school offer right now. 
I enjoy learning English and love CS, so I chose to go abroad to further my education.
It is a big decision because there would be plenty of things you need to work on: required tests, GPAs, publications, and so forth.
To be honest, I didn't prepare all these things very well. I made detours along the process. But I believe detours can make good lessons sometimes. So I am writing this post to share some of my ideas.


## First, A Question For You

### How determined are you on going studying abroad?
A. I am very determined.  
B. Would like to, but not that sure.  
C. I prefer postgraduate recommendation.  
D. I prefer taking postgraduate entrance exams.  
E. I prefer finding a job.  

- *For those who choose A:*  
It is great that you are so determined. Go on for latter parts of this post. They will be a help.

- *For those who choose B:*  
You are in the same situation as I was. My suggestion for you is- **prepare for both A and C.**
It is totally possible for that both options depend largely on your major subjects' grades. Earning a postgraduate recommendation wouldn't be a burden if you have achieved(or you are confident on achieving) good results for many of your courses, most of which are supposed to precede the end of your Junior year.  
You can take all required tests for studying abroad before your Senior year, which would free you for working for a postgraduate recommendation in the last summer vacation of your college life. Usually all places for recommendation would be decided by the middle of September in your Senior year. It is still OK if you didn't take required tests before the start of your Senior year. Normally applying for a domestic graduate school is not that hard. There would still be time for you to take exams like GRE, TOEFL while earning a recommendation. (For example, most U.S. graduate schools' application deadlines are in December or November. In that case, you would still have about 2 month for taking tests and preparing paperworks.)

- *For those who choose D:*  
Postgraduate entrance exams require extreme hard work and long-time preparing.
If you are not that optimistic about earning yourself a postgraduate recommendation, don't hesitate to start preparing for your entrance exam. In normal cases, a no less than 5 months preparation is necessary. So plan ahead, start early, and focus on it.

- *For those who choose E:*  
Directly finding a job is a thrilling option. But there are chances you change your mind in a year or two, or even after several years of working. I came to JLU with a very settled mind of looking for a job after graduation. Ironically, look where am I now.  
If you change your mind halfway, it is totally Ok. Just take those tests needed for an admission and prepare your documents. You can apply a graduate school at any time. (Many of my friends decided to go for further education abroad even if they had been working for many years.) **But do note that even if you are not a student applicant, your undergraduate grades still matters.**


## Tests to Take
If you have continued to this part, you are at least interested in studying abroad. To give you a bad news, preparing for required test are usually tedious and hard. However things would be better if you enjoy English as a culture, other than a language. In latter parts I will give some tips on learning English. So here let's head back to the topic: tests.  
There are normally two kinds of tests:  
1. **Language Tests** ([TOEFL][TOEFL-SITE], [IELTS][IELTS-SITE])  
For the first category, all the tests focus on measuring test taker's language usage level. Depending on the words you choose, the sentences you write, you scores may vary. But that doesn't mean you should always choose hard words over easy ones. Using a difficult word in a wrong way could be catastrophic. So instead of using difficult words, pick words you can manage.  
2. **Ability Tests** ([GRE][GRE-SITE], [GMAT][GMAT-SITE], [LSAT][LSAT-SITE])  
For the second category, most tests focus on your reasoning ability, logical analysing ability, quantative ability, and so forth. In this kinds of exams, language is considered a tool for conveying your thought. So you are not likely going to get a better score by doing things like replacing 'hard-working' with 'assiduous'. But by improving your logical reasoning skills and practicing a lot, I am sure you can achieve higher scores.
