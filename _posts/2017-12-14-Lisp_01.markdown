# Run Lisp
In Emacs, `M-x run-lisp` would bring `*inferior-lisp*` buffer. In a lisp mode buffer, you can put the cursor behind the line or region you want to evaluate, and press `C-M-x`. The content would be sent to `*inferior-lisp*` buffer.

# Experimenting with Lisp(CCL)

```lisp
(+ 2 3)
```

**Anything in parentheses is a list**. First element is treated as the name of a function and the rest of the elements as expressions to be evaluated to yield the arguments to the function.

```lisp
"hello, world"
```
The printer tries to print objects in the same syntax the reader understands.
